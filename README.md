The sensor used is ultrasonic sensor; hc-sr04p, which can be operated with 3.3V supply (for NODEMCU).
The code to understand the ultrasonic sensor and how it works.
Using the LED as a trigger to alert the user it in presence of obstacle.

## Adafruit MQTT

  Connect to the Adafruit MQTT.
  Making the project become a Internet of Things.
  The MQTT can monitor and record the distance measured by the sensor.
